# GA-String-Finder:
The given code implements a simple genetic algorithm to find a target string by generating random mutations and selecting the best candidates based on their fitness scores. The fitness score is calculated as the number of characters in the candidate that match the corresponding characters in the target string. The process of mutation and selection is repeated until the target string is found or a maximum number of generations is reached.

This code serves as a basic demonstration of the concept of genetic algorithms and can be used as a starting point for more advanced optimization problems. The code can be easily modified to handle different types of targets, fitness functions, and mutation rates.
